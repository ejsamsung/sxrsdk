/**
 * Utility for ordering operations that will be executed on multiple threads,
 * but need to be run sequentially, not concurrently.
 * <p>
 * For example:
 * <ul>
 * <li>Background thread: load bitmaps</li>
 * <li>GL thread: create SXRBitmapTextures for those bitmaps</li>
 * <li>Main thread: non-trivial set-up of quads that use the textures</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * Using {@code ExecutionChain} this would be structured as:
 * <p>
 *
 * <pre>
 * {@code
 *  new ExecutionChain(sxrContext)
 *      .runOnBackgroundThread(bitmapLoadingTask)
 *      .runOnGLThread(bitmapTextureTask)
 *      .runOnMainThread(quadSetupTask)
 *      .execute();
 * }
 * </pre>
 * <p>
 * The chain of execution can be {@linkplain #cancel() cancelled} at any time (a
 * {@link Runnable} can optionally be called when the cancellation has
 * completed). At a minimum, execution will halt as soon as the current task has
 * finished running. {@linkplain Task Tasks} can support finer-grained
 * cancellation by intermittently checking {@link Task#isCancelled()} and
 * returning sooner.
 * <p>
 * When a task throws an exception from run(), the exception is caught and
 * saved. If the next task in the chain of execution calls
 * {@link Task#getResult() getResult()}, the exception will be re-thrown. In
 * this way, the exception will be propagated through the chain of execution
 * until it is handled or until the chain is done executing. The next task can
 * check for an exception in the previous task by called
 * {@link Task#hasException()}, and can get the exception using
 * {@link Task#getException()}. Calling {@code getException()} clears the
 * exception state: calling {@link Task#getResult()} on the previous task will
 * <em>not</em> re-throw the exception and responsibility for handling the
 * exception now falls on the current task. An important thing to note is that
 * if the task after a throwing task doesn't call {@code Task#getResult()} or
 * handle the exception explicitly, the exception is "dropped".
 * <p>
 * If there is a need to avoid dropped exceptions, an {@link ErrorCallback} can
 * be {@link #setErrorCallback(ErrorCallback) installed}. It will be called for
 * any exceptions that are thrown and can process the exception in any way
 * necessary; if appropriate, the callback can {@link #cancel() stop further
 * execution}.
 * <p>
 * {@code ExecutionChain} supports running tasks on the
 * {@link Activity#runOnUiThread(Runnable) UI thread}, {@link MainThread main
 * thread}, {@link SXRContext#runOnGlThread(Runnable) OpenGL thread}, and on
 * {@link com.samsungxr.utility.Threads#spawn(Runnable) background threads}.
